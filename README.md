# GR Reading Notes

The file [Physics_535_RN.pdf](./PHYSICS_535_RN.pdf) is my reading notes for Physics 535 (General Relativity) at the University of Michigan. I took notes in my notebook during class. This LaTeX version serves the purpose of organizing my thoughts after class and recording new insights I gained from reading the textbook(s) on my own. I plan to update it on a monthly basis.

### Textbooks Used
* Introducing Einstein's Relativity (Ray d'Inverno)
* Spacetime and Geometry (Sean Caroll)
* General Relativity (Robert M. Wald)
