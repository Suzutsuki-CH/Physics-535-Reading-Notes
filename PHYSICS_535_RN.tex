	\section{Galilean Transformation}
	In Newtonian mechanics, we apply Galilean transformations when changing perspectives between (inertial) frames. Suppose a point $P$ in frame $S'$ is measured to have spacetime coordinate $P_{S'}(x',y',z', t')$, with \bluebf{Galilean transformation}, its spacetime coordinate in $S$ is given by:
	\begin{align*}
	P_S (x'+vt,y',z', t')
	\end{align*}
	
	\section{Principles of Special Relativity}
	We start with a theory that underpins the Newtonian theory. 
	
	\begin{center}
	
	
	\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{\bluebf{restricted principle of special relativity}
	
	\vspace*{0.3cm}	
	All inertial observers are equivalent as far as the dynamical experiments are concerned.
	}}
	
	\end{center}
	This states that observers should observe the same result for identical dynamical experiments that are performed in  inertial frames. However, Einstein realized that there are no \textit{purely dynamical} experiments, and therefore modified the statement and obtained the first postulate of special relativity.
	\begin{center}
	
	
	\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{\bluebf{Postulate I. Principle of Special Relativity}
	
	\vspace*{0.3cm}	
	All inertial observers are equivalent.
	}}
	
	\end{center}
	
	\section{The Constancy of Velocity of Light}
	To describe events (points in spacetime) with $k$-calculus, we use ``radar methods'' to measure time and distance, that is, sending light signals to the event and receive the signal reflected from it. By setting the speed of light equals 1 with natural units, we can define the distance of an object by half of the time difference between emission and reception. The reason to use light is the second postulate, which resulted from observation on binary stars.
	\begin{center}
	
	
	\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{\bluebf{Postulate I. Constancy of Velocity of Light}
	
	\vspace*{0.3cm}	
	The velocity of light $c$ is the same in all inertial systems.
	}}
	
	\end{center}
	Physically, the velocity of light takes a numerical value of $c = 2.9979\times 10^8$m/s. However, in discussions about relativity, we usually adopt natural units, in which $c:=1$.
	
	\section{Lorentz Transformation}
	From the two postulates, we are able to derive the transformation, equivalent to Galilean's, but in a relativistic configuration.
	
	Suppose frame $S'$ is moving (away) at a speed $v$ with respect to frame $S$ in $x$-direction. Given the measurements $P(x,y,z,t)$ in frame $S$, the measurement by an observer in frame $S'$ is given by:
	\begin{align*}
	P'\cb{\frac{t-vx}{\sqrt{1-v^2}}, \frac{x-vt}{\sqrt{1-v^2}}, y, z}
	\end{align*}
	We noticed that:
	\begin{align*}
	\lim_{v\to 0}P' = P
	\end{align*}
	\section{The Four-Dimensional World View}
	In Lorentz transformation, we see $x$ dependence in $t$, this is a major difference from Galilean point of view, in which the absolute time frame is invariant. It is also useful to notice the symmetry in space and time, and the mixing of space and time. Quoting Minkowski, ``Henceforth space byitself, and time by itself are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality'', we try to discover a quantity that remains invariant under Lorentz Transformations like $\Delta t$ and $\Delta r$ under Galilean Transformations.
	
	We define the metric in Minkowski space-time $\cb{\text{the space of } (t,x,y,z)\in\mathbb{R}^4}$ to be
	\begin{align*}
	\Delta s^2 = (t_1-t_2)^2 - (x_1-x_2)^2 - (y_1-y_2)^2 - (z_1-z_2)^2
	\end{align*}
	It is the squared interval between events $(t_1, x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(t_2, x_2, y_2, z_2)$. Infinitesimally, we have:
	\begin{align*}
	ds^2 = dt^2 - dx^2 - dy^2-dz^2
	\end{align*}
	This quantity ($\Delta s^2$, or $ds^2$) is invariant under Lorentz Transformation.\\
	Note, the Lorentz Transformation defined in the previous section is only the valid when the two frames are oriented in the standard way - the relative velocity between the two are in $x$-direction. When dealing with a more general orientation case, one can always apply rotation to turn the configuration in to a standard one, as long as the relative velocity $v$ is a fixed vector without acceleration.
	
	\section{The $k$-factor}
	We can finally introduce $k$-calculus in the study of special relativity. For simplicity, let's start from 2-dimension spacetime (t,x).
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=12cm]{Chap1/1-1}\\
	Figure 1-1: World lines of observer $A$ in $S$ and $B$ in $S'$, $S'$ is moving away from $S$ with a speed $v$ in $x$ direction. The light rays form an angle of $\pi/4$ with respect to the $x$-axis as we are using the natural unit where $c:=1$.
	\end{center}
	In Fig 2.7 of 1-1, we see that A sent 2 light rays to $B$ with a time interval $T$. It is reasonable to assume that the interval between receiving two light rays measured by $B$ is $kT$, proportional to $T$ by a constant $k$. Obviously, $k$-factor is a quantity that is characteristic of the motion of $B$ relative to $A$. We also assume that if $A$ and $B$ are inertial observers, $k$ is constant in time. While doing this, we are implicitly assuming a linear relationship between the space and time coordinates of $A$ and $B$.
